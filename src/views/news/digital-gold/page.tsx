        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-center text-gray-800 mb-4">Understanding $TOR: Digital Gold of the Future</h1>
        
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          The $TOR token, integral to the Tonoreum blockchain ecosystem, is poised to redefine the landscape of digital assets. With its innovative features and strategic design, $TOR combines the best elements of cryptocurrency with the enduring value characteristics of gold, positioning itself as 'digital gold' for a new era.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Intrinsic Value and Scarcity</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Similar to gold, the $TOR token offers intrinsic value through its limited supply and the utility it provides within the Tonoreum ecosystem. The tokenomics of $TOR ensure that only a fixed amount of 21 billion tokens will ever exist, mimicking the scarcity that adds to goldâ€™s allure and financial stability.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Utility and Demand</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Beyond scarcity, the utility of $TOR in facilitating transactions, enabling smart contracts, and serving as a stake in the governance of the Tonoreum network drives its demand. This utility ensures that $TOR is not just a speculative asset but a fundamental part of a thriving digital economy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Security and Stability</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Tonoreum employs state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect user data, analogous to the security of gold in a vault. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that $TOR remains protected from manipulation and centralized failure, akin to the stability gold offers against fiat currency volatility.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Long-Term Investment</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Like gold, which has been a reliable long-term investment, $TOR is designed for sustainability. The halving events and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism ensure that mining $TOR becomes more challenging over time, potentially increasing its value as fewer tokens are released.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-6">
          As $TOR continues to integrate with DeFi platforms, cross-chain ecosystems, and real-world applications, its role as digital gold becomes increasingly concrete. Investors and users of the Tonoreum network can look forward to a robust digital asset that stands the test of time, offering both security and growth potential in the digital age.
