        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Advancements in Mining Technology</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          With a focus on leveraging the latest in blockchain technology, Tonoreum is optimizing its mining protocols to ensure that each participant has an equitable chance to contribute and earn rewards. This approach addresses one of the most pressing concerns in the blockchain communityâ€”energy-efficient mining practices.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          The mining platform's infrastructure expansion involves integrating a user-friendly mining interface with real-time statistics, seamless integration with Telegram for managing mining activities, and introducing Proof of Work tasks that allow for an alternative way to increase computational power.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Accessible Mining for All</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          One of the key goals of this infrastructure expansion is to lower the barriers to entry, making mining a more inclusive activity. Regardless of the participants' technical expertise, Tonoreum ensures that everyone has access to mining opportunities.
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
            <li>Miners can start with basic computational power and increase it by participating in the network activities.</li>
            <li>New users receive a starting computational power bonus, incentivizing continued network growth through referrals.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Sustainability and Longevity</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Tonoreum's mining infrastructure is not only designed for the present but also with an eye on the future. By creating a system that rewards long-term participation and fosters sustainable growth, Tonoreum is setting the stage for a new era of blockchain mining.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-6">
          The expansion of the mining platform is a testament to Tonoreum's dedication to creating a robust and dynamic ecosystem. The project remains committed to continuous improvements and innovations to meet and exceed the community's expectations.
