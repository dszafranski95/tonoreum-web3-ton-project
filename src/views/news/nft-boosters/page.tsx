        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Tonoreum is innovating the intersection of NFTs and mining by introducing NFT Boosters to the ecosystem. These unique digital assets will provide miners with enhanced computational power, marking a significant shift in the mining dynamic on the TON blockchain.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">Innovative Utility of NFTs</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          NFT Boosters in Tonoreum's platform are designed to offer more than just collectability. They represent a tangible utility by boosting miners' computational powerâ€”TOR Power. This functionality is pivotal as it directly influences a miner's ability to earn rewards.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">The Role of NFT Boosters in Mining</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          Each NFT Booster offers a multiplier effect on the mining capabilities of a user. For instance, NFTs might come with multipliers such as x2, x4, x6, or even x8, significantly accelerating the earning potential for miners.
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 my-4">
            <li>NFTs can be acquired through participation in the network and specific mining-related tasks.</li>
            <li>They can also be purchased, traded, or sold, adding a layer of strategy to the mining process.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">A Sustainable Economic Model</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
          The introduction of NFT Boosters is accompanied by an innovative economic mechanism. To acquire these boosters, miners can "burn" $TOR tokens, effectively reducing the overall token supply and creating a deflationary pressure that can potentially increase the token's value over time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-6">
          Tonoreum's strategic use of NFTs reflects a commitment to continuously exploring new avenues for growth and engagement within its community. The project's foresight in enhancing the mining experience through gamification sets a new standard for others in the space.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-6">
          These developments in Tonoreum's NFT strategy showcase the project's dedication to leveraging blockchain technology's full potential. It's a step towards a future where NFTs play a central role in the functionality and economy of decentralized platforms.
